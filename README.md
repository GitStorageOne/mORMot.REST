# mORMot.REST
Testing mORMot REST capabilities.
It's my first meeting with mORMot, so, something may be unoptimized or implemented wrong.
Feel free to post your suggestions.
Don't forget that this is not final build, there is a lot to do.

I use REST services via interfaces, IMO it's more friendly for developers.
You may find that project group contain both server and client projects.
In addition, you can use .jmx files with apache jmeter to simulate multiclient heavy load via HTTP connection.
